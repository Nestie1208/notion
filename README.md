Powerful building blocks


Visualize, filter & sort any way you want
Show only tasks assigned to you, or items marked as urgent. Break down any project in the way that’s most helpful to you.

List

Customize the info you track
Create your own labels, tags, owners, and more, so everyone has context and everything stays organized.



Build any page, communicate any idea
Everything is drag and drop in Notion — images, toggles, to-do’s, even embedded databases.



Notion adapts to your needs. It’s as minimal or as powerful as you need it to be.

I used to HATE documenting things. And then I started using @NotionHQ and I document a lot. A LOT A LOT. Now I just realize that it wasn't that I hated documenting, I just hated Google Docs.

One of the most incredible things about @NotionHQ is the dynamic community being built - creating and sharing at its best.
